# Multimodal Deep Learning for Emotion Recognition in Child Babbling

Abstract:
This project attempts to use deep learning methods to conduct emotional detection and classification on child babbling. The larger importance of this research would be to use it as a tool for emotional interpretation, and more importantly, for emergency detection, for caretakers of infants and toddlers. Already, there have been studies using deep learning emotion detection in audio for important causes, such as for PTSD detection (K Islam, ZelSayed).
